* Simple Yew Login Form

I wanted to try some of the Rust WebApp frameworks to get an idea of how mature they
are and their problems. As a simple test, I decided to write a "login" page form with
a logo image, a submit button and two text fields. One for the username and one for the password.
The submit button prints to the console the inputtd username and password.

To run the app, execute

#+begin_src bash
trunk serve
#+end_src
